#covert-http
covert-http uses the idea of covert sockets to hide data within the TCP Sequence Numbers that deliver HTTP data. 
The covert-http server operates as a proxy and allows for an actual legitimate website to be loaded. This allows
users to trigger and operate a transfer simply by visting a website in the browser and navigating its pages. With the 
covert-http client installed, the covert message can be deciphered from the data stream. Using the website's content to
hide the data, Wireshark or network observations will show a legitimate HTTP transfer with valid TCP Sequence numbers 
being passed.
